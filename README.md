## 🌱 About Me

I'm a **self-taught developer** currently completing my Class 12 studies in India. I believe technology should empower and protect communities, not just serve commercial interests. 

While my peers are focused solely on entrance exams, I'm building **real-world solutions** — from women's safety apps to AI-powered alert systems — because I believe the best way to learn is by solving problems that matter.

I'm teaching myself **full-stack development, cybersecurity fundamentals, and ethical AI** through online courses, documentation, and hands-on projects. My goal is to pursue computer engineering abroad and continue building technology that creates positive social change.

## 🌟 Community & Impact

**🎯 What Drives Me:**

I come from a middle-class family in India where access to quality tech education is limited. I've seen firsthand how lack of digital literacy makes people vulnerable to scams, how women feel unsafe using public transport, and how students struggle without mental health resources.

These aren't just "problems to solve" — they're realities affecting people I care about. That's why I code.

**🤝 Community Contributions:**

- **Volunteer Educator:** Taught basic cyber awareness to 100+ school students in my local community
- **Open Source Contributor:** Contributed to documentation and beginner-friendly issues in projects focused on safety and education
- **Mentorship:** Help junior developers on Discord communities with Python and Flutter basics
- **Tech Blog:** Write tutorials on building secure applications for beginners (Medium, Dev.to)

**📢 Talks & Workshops (School/Local Level):**
- "Introduction to Cybersecurity for Students" – Local tech meetup
- "Building Your First App with Flutter" – School computer club workshop

## 🎯 Why I'm Applying for This Scholarship

Coming from a developing country, I've witnessed the transformative power of technology — and its absence. I want to study computer engineering abroad not just for personal growth, but to bring back knowledge and build solutions that can scale across communities in India and beyond.

**My Vision:**
- Build **ethical AI systems** that prioritize user privacy and safety
- Develop **accessible cybersecurity tools** for non-technical users in developing countries
- Create **social impact technology** that addresses real problems like safety, education inequality, and digital literacy
- Bridge the gap between cutting-edge research and grassroots implementation

I believe universities like **UBC, Monash, and University of Canberra** will provide me with:
- Access to world-class faculty and research in AI ethics and cybersecurity
- Diverse perspectives from international peers
- Resources to scale my projects to global impact
- Mentorship to become a responsible technologist

**I'm not just seeking a degree — I'm seeking the tools to make a difference.**
